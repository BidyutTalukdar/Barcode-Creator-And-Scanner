# Barcode-Creator-And-Scanner
###Welcome to the Barcode-Creator-And-Scanner wiki! We have started to work on this program Taking an idea of the collect piece of data with the help of Barcode and along with this, we can do data manipulation also.

It is like an app that will scan the barcode save the data in editable form as well as display the data and also it has an option for sending the data to the main server where we can visualize the data.

Our app contains 7 fields Barcodeinfo, Name, Price, Address, Color, Weight, and Size. Below the Fields, it has Buttons Save, Sends and Use_GPS Purpose of this Button Save-> To save the data into the app database Send-> To send data to the server database Use_GPS-> For Finding the current location using GPS

Procedure

Install the app (Barcode.apk) only for android devices
Import the appdata.sql to your server and database name should be mydb(Technically mydb is a relation and appdata.sql is a table)
Make a file on your PC and paste the remain files (seller.php, savedata.php,coursescl.php,dbconnect.php) into it and start your server
